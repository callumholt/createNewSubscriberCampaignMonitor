The purpose of this app is to take some simple form inputs and POST that data to an API of a CRM called "campaign monitor" (CM). 

This data should be added as a new subscriber to a specific list in CM.

When this new subscriber is added, it will trigger an automation within CM to automatically add the new subscriber to an email campaign.

So effectively, the entire effect of this app, is it will take some simple form inputs and when submitted the new subscriber will receive a personalised email based on the inputs that were POST'ed to the API.
